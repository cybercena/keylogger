## this code does not promote or encourage any illegal activities!  the content in this document is  provided solely for educational purpose and to create awareness!
### this is a proof of concept and could be improved on in a lot of ways
1. to run this code use ```git clone https://github.com/cybercena/keylogger.git```
2. run the command ```cd keylogger```
3. Create and activate virtual environment if needed because , pynput is not a builtin library.
4. run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or  ```pip install pynput ```.
